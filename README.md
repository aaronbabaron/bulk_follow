# Bulk follow Github and LinkedIn users

The Github script `follow_gh.py` will follow users. The LinkedIn script `follow_li.py` will send a invitation for each user or if the user has already sent you an invitation the script will automatically accept their invitation.

1) Place your .csv file in this repo's root directory. Make sure GitHub and LinkedIn user handles are located in the 3rd and 4th column and start on the 3rd row. Reference the format in `contacts.example.csv` for clarification.

2) Change `config.example.py` to `config.py` and fill in Github username and password along with .csv filename

3) Install `pip`: Mac OS: `sudo easy_install pip`. Linux: `sudo apt-get install python-pip`. 

4) Install Python dependencies: Navigate to root directory of repo and in terminal type `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5) Install `chromedriver`. Mac OS: `brew install chromedriver`. Linux: http://stackoverflow.com/a/24364290

6) Execute scripts: 

**Github** 
  * In the terminal type `python follow_gh.py` or `python3 follow_gh.py`

**LinkedIn** 
  * In the terminal type `python follow_li.py` or `python3 follow_li.py`

**Troubleshooting**
  * Mac users: When running the scripts if there is an error message pertaining to Chrome driver not found then your Chrome brower may not be installed in the location. Reinstall `google-chrome` using this command `brew cask install google-chrome`.

_Some people's Github and/or LinkedIn handles may be missing, contain typos or have already been followed. Feedback will be provided in the terminal when running the script._
